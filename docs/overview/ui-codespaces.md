# Use GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces][codespaces] is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud.

The easiest way to get started is to [fork] the [Planetary Computer Examples][examples] repository and create a new Codespace (we recommend [setting a default region](#setting-a-default-region) first).

![Start codespaces from the "Code" dropdown.](images/codespaces-start.png)

This will create a Codespace under your GitHub account that's configured to work well with our data.

When you launch a notebook you'll be prompted to select a kernel. Choose the `'notebook': conda` kernel.

## Set a default region

We recommend that you create your Codespaces in the West Europe. You can do this per-Codespace, or set a [default region][region].

This ensures that your compute node is in the same Azure region as the data, giving the highest performance when accessing data from the [Planetary Computer catalog][catalog].

## Use Planetary Computer environments

Your Codespace uses a [dev container][container] to provide all the software and tools needed to do your data analysis and software development.

We publish our environments, which contain many packages useful for geospatial data analysis, at <https://github.com/microsoft/planetary-computer-containers>. These can be used in the Codespaces [configuration] for your project to ensure you have access to those packages.
