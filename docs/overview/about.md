# About the Microsoft Planetary Computer

The Microsoft Planetary Computer is a platform that lets users leverage the power of the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) cloud to accelerate environmental sustainability and Earth science.

The Planetary Computer consists of four major components:
- The [Data Catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog), which includes petabytes of data about Earth systems, hosted on Azure and made available to users for free.
- [APIs](../concepts/stac.md) that allow users to search for the data they need across space and time.
- The [Hub](../concepts/computing.md), a fully managed computing environment that allows scientists to process massive geospatial datasets.
- [Applications](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/applications), built by our network of partners, that put the Planetary Computer platform to work for environmental sustainability.

## Built on Open

The Planetary Computer is uses open-source tools and supports open standards. In fact, the foundation of the Planetary Computer is the incredible ecosystem of tools being developed in the open by our partners and the much broader open-source community. For example, our Hub builds on the work done by the [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io/) community to put the tools of data science to work for the Earth science community, and our API builds on the work done by the [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) community to streamline and standardize the cataloging and discovery of geospatial data.

## About Private Preview

While the Planetary Computer data and APIs are publicly accessible, certain features of the Planetary Computer are in Private Preview and require access be granted. Use the [request access form](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/account/request) to express your interest in becoming an early user.

We're just getting started. Check back for updated documentation and new features!
