### Hub environments

#### Support for batch workflows

The Planetary Computer Hub is now integrated with [kbatch](https://kbatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to run asynchronous / batch workflow jobs, complementing JupyterHub's support
for interactive computing. See the [kbatch overview](../overview/batch) and the [kbatch documentation](https://kbatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more.

#### New package versions

The Planetary Computer Hub has been upgraded to use container images from the [planetary-computer-containers 2022.01.17.0 release](https://github.com/microsoft/planetary-computer-containers/releases/tag/2022.01.17.0). In particular, this release includes

- pystac-client 0.3.2, with support for cql2-json queries

### Hub environments

#### New package versions

The Planetary Computer Hub has been upgraded to use container images from the [planetary-computer-containers 2021.09.27.0 release](https://github.com/microsoft/planetary-computer-containers/releases/tag/2021.09.27.0).
Among other changes, these container images include

* pystac-client 0.3.0b1
* dask-geopandas 0.1.0a4
* planetary-computer 0.4.2

See the release notes for the changes in the various packages provided in the Planetary Computer's environment.

```{note}
pystac-client 0.2.0 doesn't recognize the new conformance classes provided by the Planetary Computer's STAC API. Either set "ignore_conformance=True" when creating your pystac Client, or upgrade to pystac-client>=0.3.0b1.
```

### Website

* New guide for deploying your own Hub: <https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/concepts/hub-deployment/>
* New guide for accessing Planetary Computer datasets from [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces): <https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/overview/ui-codespaces/>

## August 2021

This minor release has the following __breaking__ changes:

- The `sentinel-2-l2a` Item IDs have been updated to include the Product Discriminator number. See [this stactools issue](https://github.com/stactools-packages/sentinel2/issues/5) for more information.
- The `sentinel-2-l2a` Items have removed the downsampled version of assets. This includes renaming asset keys to no longer have the resolution; for example, `visual-10m` has been renamed to `visual` and `visual-20m` has been removed.

#### New datasets

- [JRC Global Surface Water](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/jrc-gsw): surface water distribution from 1984 to 2020, based on data from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 sensors.

## July 2021

### Highlights

* The [STAC API][stac-api] is now compliant with [STAC 1.0](https://medium.com/radiant-earth-insights/stac-specification-1-0-0-released-c59e8c848077).
* Added a new Data API with several features, including the ability to preview datasets and items. See [Data API](docs/overview/changelog/#data-api) below for more.
* Added support for Earth-systems datasets in our STAC catalog. See [Datasets](./docs/overview/changelog/#datasets) below for more.
* The Hub environment Dockerfiles and images are now publicly available. See [Hub environments](docs/overview/changelog/#hub-environments) below for more.

### APIs

#### STAC API

##### New features

- Supports STAC 1.0
- Supports the [Query extension](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/query)
- Utilizes the latest [stac-fastapi](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-fastapi) backed by [pgstac](https://github.com/stac-utils/pgstac)

##### Breaking changes

- Users will need to use tools that work with STAC 1.0 with the STAC API. As STAC 1.0 was recently released, the state of the tools ecosystem is still catching up. See [the new Hub package versions](docs/overview/changelog/#new-package-versions) below for packages that will work with the STAC API.

#### Data API

This is a new API that provides [titiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/) endpoints for our
STAC Items. There are also collection tile endpoints for
some datasets. See the [Data API docs](../reference/data.md) for a list of endpoints available. These endpoints are not available for all Collections and Items. For Collections and Items that have visualization endpoints, assets are added for [TileJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec) and links for simple Leaflet map previews are added by the STAC API. For example, <https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/data/v1/collection/map?collection=io-lulc> is the preview link for the new [Esri 10-Meter Land Cover](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/data/v1/collection/map?collection=io-lulc) dataset.

The Data API should be considered in an alpha state - expect updates and breaking changes in the future.

### Datasets

The full list of new datasets is provided below, but we wanted to highlight that that a new *kind* of dataset is now available through our STAC API. In addition to our remote sensing datasets stored as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs, we're also hosting and cataloging data stored in [Zarr][zarr] format. See [this Daymet dataset](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/daymet-monthly-hi) for an example. This work was done with the [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) and [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) communities, and spurred improvements to the [datacube](https://github.com/stac-extensions/datacube) STAC extension and the creation of the [xarray-assets](https://github.com/stac-extensions/xarray-assets) STAC extension.

#### New datasets

The following datasets are now available in our [data catalog][catalog] and [STAC API][stac-api]:

* [Daymet Collection](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/group/daymet): gridded estimates of weather parameters for North America, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico at daily, monthly, and annual temporal resolutions
* [Esri 10-Meter Land Cover](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/io-lulc): a 10-meter resolution map of Earthâ€™s land surface from 2020

#### Changes to existing datasets

* New items from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 are now continuously available through the STAC API
* Changed the item IDs for [Sentinel-2 Level-2A](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-2-l2a) and [Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level-2](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-8-c2-l2) to not include the processing date
* Fixed issues with missing Sentinel-2 scenes
* Fixed various quality issues with some Landsat 8 scenes by updating to the most recently processed version available from USGS
* Fixed Landsat 8 STAC item footprints being off by half a pixel

### Hub environments
