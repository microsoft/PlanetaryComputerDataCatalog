The FIA research program has been in existence since mandated by Congress in 1928. FIA's primary objective is to determine the extent, condition, volume, growth, and use of trees on the nation's forest land.\n\nDomain: continental U.S., 1928-2018\n\nResolution: plot-level (irregular polygon)\n\nThis dataset was curated and brought to Azure by [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org/).",
