ERA5 is produced by the\\nCopernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF.\\n\\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a\\nglobally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This\\nprinciple, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical\\nweather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a\\nprevious forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal\\nway to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called\\nanalysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works\\nin the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a\\ndataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint\\nof issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and\\nwhen going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions\\nof the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis\\nproduct.\\n\\nThis dataset was converted to Zarr by [Planet OS](https://planetos.com/).\\n\\nTwo types of data variables are provided: \"forecast\" (`fc`) and \"analysis\" (`an`).\\n\\n* An **analysis**, of the atmospheric conditions, is a blend of observations\\n  with a previous forecast. An analysis can only provide\\n  [instantaneous](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Model+grid+box+and+time+step)\\n  parameters (parameters valid at a specific time, e.g temperature at 12:00),\\n  but not accumulated parameters, mean rates or min/max parameters.\\n* A **forecast** starts with an analysis at a specific time (the 'initialization\\n  time'), and a model computes the atmospheric conditions for a number of\\n  'forecast steps', at increasing 'validity times', into the future. A forecast\\n  can provide\\n  [instantaneous](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Model+grid+box+and+time+step)\\n  parameters, accumulated parameters, mean rates, and min/max parameters.\\n\\nEach [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) item in this collection covers a single month\\nand the entire globe. There are two STAC items per month, one for each type of data\\nvariable (`fc` and `an`). The STAC items include an `ecmwf:kind` properties to\\nindicate which kind of variables that STAC item catalogs.","stac_version":"1.0.0","cube:variables":{"time1_bounds":{"type":"data","attrs":{},"shape":[null,2],"dimensions":["time","nv"]},"surface_air_pressure":{"type":"data","unit":"Pa","attrs":{"units":"Pa","nameCDM":"Surface_pressure_surface","long_name":"Surface
