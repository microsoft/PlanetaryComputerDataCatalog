    The gridded National Soil Survey Geographic Database (gNATSGO) is a USDA-NRCS
    Soil & Plant Science Division (SPSD) composite database that provides complete
    coverage of the best available soils information for all areas of the United
    States and Island Territories. It was created by combining data from the Soil
    Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO2),
    and Raster Soil Survey Databases (RSS) into a single seamless ESRI file
    geodatabase.


    SSURGO is the SPSD flagship soils database that has over 100 years of
    field-validated detailed soil mapping data. SSURGO contains soils information for
    more than 90 percent of the United States and island territories, but unmapped
    land remains. STATSGO2 is a general soil map that has soils data for all of the
    United States and island territories, but the data is not as detailed as the
    SSURGO data. The Raster Soil Surveys (RSSs) are the next generation soil survey
    databases developed using advanced digital soil mapping methods.


    The gNATSGO database is composed primarily of SSURGO data, but STATSGO2 data was
    used to fill in the gaps. The RSSs are newer product with relatively limited
    spatial extent. These RSSs were merged into the gNATSGO after combining the
    SSURGO and STATSGO2 data. The extent of RSS is expected to increase in the coming
    years.

    Tabular and gridded Climate Normals for the United States
  description: >
    The [NOAA US Climate Normals](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/us-climate-normals)
    provide information about typical climate conditions for thousands of weather
    station locations across the United States. Normals act both as a ruler to
    compare current weather and as a predictor of conditions in the near future.
    The official normals are calculated for a uniform 30 year period for almost
    15,000 weather stations, and consist of annual/seasonal, monthly, daily, and
    hourly averages and statistics of temperature, precipitation, and other
    climatological variables for each weather station.


    In addition to tabular Climate Normal data for each weather station location,
    gridded Climate Normals for temperature and precipitation variables are also
    available. Daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual gridded Climate Normals are
    provided in 1/24 degree lat/lon (nominal 5x5 kilometer) grids for the
    contiguous United States.

    Annual land cover and cover change maps for the conterminous United States and Hawaii
  description: >
    The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) [Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/lcmap)
    (LCMAP) product provides land cover mapping and change monitoring from the
    USGS's [Earth Resources Observation and Science](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros)
    (EROS) Center. LCMAP's Science Products are developed by applying time-series
    modeling on a per-pixel basis to [Landsat Analysis Ready Data](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-us-analysis-ready-data)
    (ARD) using an implementation of the [Continuous Change Detection and Classification](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.01.011)
    (CCDC) algorithm. All available clear (non-cloudy) U.S. Landsat ARD
    observations are fit to a harmonic model to predict future Landsat-like
    surface reflectance. Where Landsat surface reflectance observations differ
    significantly from those predictions, a change is identified. Attributes of
    the resulting model sequences (e.g., start/end dates, residuals, model
    coefficients) are then used to produce a set of land surface change products
    and as inputs to the subsequent classification to thematic land cover.


    Two LCMAP Collections are provided:

    1. [LCMAP CONUS Collection 1.3](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/lcmap/collection-13-conus-science-products),
    which was released in August 2022 for years 1985-2021.

    2. [LCMAP Hawaii Collection 1.0](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/lcmap/collection-1-hawaii-science-products),
    which was released in January 2022 for years 2000-2020.


    The data are tiled according to the Landsat ARD tile grid and consist of
    [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs](https://www.cogeo.org/) (COGs) and corresponding
    metadata files. Note that the provided COGs differ slightly from those in
    the USGS source data. They have been reprocessed to add overviews, "nodata"
    values where appropriate, and an updated projection definition.

    Global annual land cover maps from 1992 to 2020 at 300m resolution
  description: >
    The ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) [Land Cover dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab=overview)
    provides consistent global annual land cover maps at 300m spatial resolution
    from 1992 to 2020. The land cover classes are defined using the United Nations
    Food and Agriculture Organization's (UN FAO) [Land Cover Classification System](https://www.fao.org/land-water/land/land-governance/land-resources-planning-toolbox/category/details/en/c/1036361/)
    (LCCS). In addition to the land cover maps, four quality flags are produced
    to document the reliability of the classification and change detection.


    The ESA CCI land cover data is provided in two forms:

    1. The source NetCDF data.

    2. Tiled [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs](https://www.cogeo.org/) (COGs) created from the source NetCDF data.
