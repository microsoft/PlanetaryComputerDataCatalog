3dep-lidar:
  title: USGS 3DEP Lidar Collection
  short_description:
    Elevation data as 3D point clouds and derived Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs using data
    from the USGS 3D Elevation Program.

  description: >
    To respond to growing needs for high-quality elevation data, the goal of 3DEP is
    to complete acquisition of nationwide lidar (IfSAR in AK) to provide the
    first-ever national baseline of consistent high-resolution topographic elevation
    data – both bare earth and 3D point clouds.

    This dataset provides the raw 3D point clouds in the [Cloud Optimized Point
    Cloud](https://copc.io/) format, and various derived products as [Cloud Optimized
    GeoTIFFs](https://www.cogeo.org/).

  description: >
    [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov) provides long-term, continuous, gridded
    estimates of daily weather and climatology variables by interpolating and
    extrapolating ground-based observations through statistical modeling techniques.
    Daymet data products have applications in Earth science, natural resource
    management, biodiversity conservation, and agricultural research.


    Daymet weather variables include daily minimum and maximum temperature,
    precipitation, vapor pressure, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, and
    day length.  All variables are produced on a 1 km x 1 km gridded surface, and are
    available from 1980 to the end of the most recent calendar year.

    Observatory](http://impactobservatory.com/), who used billions of human-labeled
    pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning
    model for land classification. The global maps were produced by applying this

    The gridded National Soil Survey Geographic Database (gNATSGO) is a USDA-NRCS

    The gridded National Soil Survey Geographic Database (gNATSGO) is a USDA-NRCS
    Soil & Plant Science Division (SPSD) composite database that provides complete
    coverage of the best available soils information for all areas of the United
    States and Island Territories. It was created by combining data from the Soil
    Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO2),
    and Raster Soil Survey Databases (RSS) into a single seamless ESRI file
    geodatabase.


    SSURGO is the SPSD flagship soils database that has over 100 years of
    field-validated detailed soil mapping data. SSURGO contains soils information for
    more than 90 percent of the United States and island territories, but unmapped
    land remains. STATSGO2 is a general soil map that has soils data for all of the
    United States and island territories, but the data is not as detailed as the
    SSURGO data. The Raster Soil Surveys (RSSs) are the next generation soil survey
    databases developed using advanced digital soil mapping methods.


    The gNATSGO database is composed primarily of SSURGO data, but STATSGO2 data was
    used to fill in the gaps. The RSSs are newer product with relatively limited
    spatial extent. These RSSs were merged into the gNATSGO after combining the
    SSURGO and STATSGO2 data. The extent of RSS is expected to increase in the coming
    years.

    Climate Impact Lab Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts Research

  description: >
    The World Climate Research Programme's [6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
    (CMIP6)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) represents an
    enormous advance in the quality, detail, and scope of climate modeling.


    The [Global Downscaled Projections for Climate Impacts
    Research](https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab/downscaleCMIP6) dataset makes this
    modeling more applicable to understanding the impacts of changes in the climate
    on humans and society with two key developments: trend-preserving bias correction
    and downscaling. In this dataset, the [Climate Impact
    Lab](https://impactlab.org/) provides global, daily minimum and maximum air
    temperature at the surface (`tasmin` and `tasmax`) and daily cumulative surface
    precipitation (`pr`) corresponding to the CMIP6 historical, ssp1-2.6, ssp2-4.5,
    ssp3-7.0, and ssp5-8.5 scenarios for 25 global climate models on a 1/4-degree
    regular global grid.


    GDPCIR data can be accessed on the Microsoft Planetary Computer. The dataset is
    made of of three collections, distinguished by data license. More information
    about the dataset is available in these collections, including access
    instructions and examples, data formats, available models, methods, and
    citation/licensing requirements, on each dataset's homepage linked below.

viirs:
  title: VIIRS Version 001 Products
  short_description: >
    The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument collects 
    global observations of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans in the 
    visible and infrared wavelengths. The VIIRS sensor was designed to extend 
    and improve upon the series of measurements initiated by its predecessors, 
    including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).

  description: >
    The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument is aboard 
    the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and National Oceanic 
    and Atmospheric Administration-20 (NOAA-20) [satellites](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/current-satellite-missions/currently-flying/joint-polar-satellite-system/jpss-mission-and). 
    The instrument has a swath width of 3,000 kilometers and observes the entire 
    surface of the Earth twice each day. It has 22 channels ranging from 0.41 
    micrometers to 12.01 micrometers, of which five are high-resolution image bands 
    (I-bands, 375 meter resolution) and sixteen serve as moderate-resolution bands (M-bands, 
    750 meter resolution). VIIRS also hosts a unique panchromatic Day/Night band 
    (DNB), which is ultra-sensitive in low-light conditions and is used to generate 
    the [VIIRS Black Marble](https://viirsland.gsfc.nasa.gov/Products/NASA/BlackMarble.html) 
    product. Many of the VIIRS product algorithms are specifically designed to promote 
    continuity with the heritage MODIS products, including spatial resampling 
    from the sensor's native 375 and 750 meter ground sample distances to 500 
    meter, 1 kilometer, and 0.05 degree resolutions.


    The Planetary Computer currently hosts Version 001 Level 3 and 4 data from the
    VIIRS instrument aboard the Suomi NPP satellite (product prefix 'VNP'). 
    Level 3 and 4 data from the VIIRS instrument aboard the NOAA-20 satellite 
    (product prefix 'VJ1') are not yet widely available. Additional product 
    information is provided on each collection's homepage.
