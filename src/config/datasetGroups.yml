  title: Daymet Collection
  short_description:
    Gridded estimates of weather parameters for North America, Hawaii, and Puerto
    Rico at daily, monthly, and annual temporal resolutions
  description: >
    [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov) provides long-term, continuous, gridded
    estimates of daily weather and climatology variables by interpolating and
    extrapolating ground-based observations through statistical modeling techniques.
    Daymet data products have applications in Earth science, natural resource
    management, biodiversity conservation, and agricultural research.

    Daymet weather variables include daily minimum and maximum temperature,
    precipitation, vapor pressure, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, and
    day length.  All variables are produced on a 1 km x 1 km gridded surface, and are
    available from 1980 to the end of the most recent calendar year.

  title: Copernicus DEM Collection
  short_description:
    Copernicus DEM is a near-global digital surface model (DSM) derived from radar
    satellite data acquired during the TanDEM-X mission.
  description: >
    The Copernicus DEM is a digital surface model (DSM), which represents the surface
    of the Earth including buildings, infrastructure, and vegetation. This DSM is
    based on radar satellite data acquired during the TanDEM-X Mission, which was
    funded by a public-private partnership between the German Aerospace Centre (DLR)
    and Airbus Defence and Space.  Copernicus DEM is available at both 30-meter and
    90-meter resolution.

io-land-cover:
  title: 10 meter Land Cover
  short_description: Global land use/land cover information at 10m resolution
  description: >
    Global estimates of land use/land cover (LULC), derived from ESA Sentinel-2
    imagery at 10m resolution. This dataset was generated by [Impact
    Observatory](http://impactobservatory.com/), who used billions of human-labeled
    pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning
    model for land classification. The global maps were produced by applying this
    model to the Sentinel-2 scene collection on the Planetary Computer.

    All of the annual LULC datasets are available under a Creative Commons BY-4.0
    license.
